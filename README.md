A simple tool to display static or dynamic Markdown snippets in the terminal, with skin isolation.

Based on [crossterm](https://github.com/TimonPost/crossterm) so works on most terminals (even on windows).

![text](doc/text.png)

The goal isn't to display any markdown text with its various extensions (a terminal isn't really fit for that). The goal is rather to improve the display of texts in a terminal application when we want both the text and the skin to be easily configured.

Termimad also includes a few utilities helping efficient managing of events and user input in a multithread application.

**Wrapping**, table balancing, and **scrolling** are essential features of Termimad.

A text or a table can be displayed in an *a priori* unknown part of the screen, scrollable if desired, with a dynamically discovered width.

For example this markdown:

	|:-:|:-:|-
	|**feature**|**supported**|**details**|
	|-:|:-:|-
	| tables | yes | pipe based, with or without alignments
	| italic, bold | yes | star based |
	| inline code | yes | `with backquotes` (it works in tables too)
	| code bloc | yes |with tabs; fences *not* supported
	| syntax coloring | no |
	| crossed text |  ~~not yet~~ | wait... now it works `~~like this~~`
	| horizontal rule | yes | Use 3 or more dashes (`---`)
	| lists | yes|* unordered lists supported
	|  | |* ordered lists *not* supported
	| quotes |  yes |> What a wonderful time to be alive!
	| links | no | (but your terminal already handles raw URLs)
	|-

will give different results depending on the width:

##  Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
termimad = "0.5"
```

### With the default skin:

```rust
termimad::print_inline("**some** *nested **style*** and `some(code)`");
```
or
```rust
print!("{}", termimad::inline("**some** *nested **style*** and `some(code)`"));
```

Result:

![simple example](doc/default-skin-simple.png)

### Inline snippets with a custom skin:

*Inline snippets* are one line or less.

```rust
let mut skin = MadSkin::default();
skin.bold.set_fg(Yellow);
skin.print_inline("*Hey* **World!** Here's `some(code)`");
skin.paragraph.set_fgbg(Magenta, rgb(30, 30, 40));
skin.italic.add_attr(Underlined);
println!("\nand now {}\n", skin.inline("a little *too much* **style!** (and `some(code)` too)"));
```

Result:

![too much style](doc/too_much.png)

#### Texts

*Texts* can be several lines. Tables and code blocks are automatically aligned, justified and consistently wrapped.

```rust
skin.print_text("# title\n* a list item\n* another item");
```

### Scrollable TextView in a raw terminal:

![scrollable](doc/scrollable.png)

The code for this example is in examples/scrollable. To read the whole text just do

    cargo run --example scrollable

### Templates

In order to separate the rendering format from the content, the `format!` macro is not always a good solution because you may not be sure the content is free of characters which may mess the markdown.

A solution is to use one of the templating functions or macros.

Example:

```
mad_print_inline!(
	&skin,
	"**$0 formula:** *$1*", // the markdown template, interpreted once
	"Disk",  // fills $0
	"2*Ï€*r", // fills $1. Note that the stars don't mess the markdown
);
```

![mad_print_inline](doc/mad_print_inline.png)

Main difference with using `print!(format!( ... ))`:
* the markdown parsing and template building are done only once (using `lazy_static` internally)
* the given values aren't interpreted as markdown fragments and don't impact the style
* arguments can be omited, repeated, given in any order
* no support for fmt parameters or arguments other than `&str` *(in the current version)*

You'll find more examples and advice in the *templates* example.

Note that there's no macro yet supporting templates for whole markdown *texts* but they should be available soon.

## Advices to get started

* Start by reading the examples (in `/examples`): they cover almost the whole API, including templates, how to use an alternate screen or scroll the page, etc.
* If you want to see how some file would look with Termimad, you may try the cli [Clima](https://github.com/Canop/clima).
* Be careful that some colors aren't displayable on all terminals. The default color set of your application should not include arbitrary RGB colors.
* If a feature is missing, or you don't know how to use some part, come and ping me on my chat during West European hours.

[broot](https://github.com/Canop/broot) is a real application using Termimad, you might want to see how it does it.

[whalespotter](https://github.com/Canop/whalespotter) has been designed specifically to showcase Termimad components in a real application.

If you're the author of another application using Termimad, please tell me.
