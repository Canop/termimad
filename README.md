A CLI utilities library leveraging Markdown to format terminal rendering, allowing separation of structure, data and skin.

Based on [crossterm](https://github.com/TimonPost/crossterm) so works on most terminals (even on windows).

![text](doc/text.png)

The goal isn't to display any markdown text with its various extensions (a terminal isn't really fit for that). The goal is rather to improve the display of texts in a terminal application when we want both the text and the skin to be easily configured.

Termimad also includes a few utilities helping efficient managing of events and user input in a multithread application.

**Wrapping**, table balancing, and **scrolling** are essential features of Termimad.

A text or a table can be displayed in an *a priori* unknown part of the screen, scrollable if desired, with a dynamically discovered width.

For example this markdown:

    |:-:|:-:|-
    |**feature**|**supported**|**details**|
    |-:|:-:|-
    | tables | yes | pipe based, with or without alignments
    | italic, bold | yes | star based |
    | inline code | yes | `with backquotes` (it works in tables too)
    | code bloc | yes |with tabs or code fences
    | syntax coloring | no |
    | crossed text |  ~~not yet~~ | wait... now it works `~~like this~~`
    | horizontal rule | yes | Use 3 or more dashes (`---`)
    | lists | yes|* unordered lists supported
    |  | |* ordered lists *not* supported
    | quotes |  yes |> What a wonderful time to be alive!
    | links | no | (but your terminal already handles raw URLs)
    |-

will give different results depending on the width:

![table](doc/table-in-60.png)

![table](doc/table-in-50.png)

##  Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
termimad = "0.14"
```

### With the default skin:

```rust
termimad::print_inline("**some** *nested **style*** and `some(code)`");
```
or
```rust
print!("{}", termimad::inline("**some** *nested **style*** and `some(code)`"));
```

Result:

![simple example](doc/default-skin-simple.png)

### Inline snippets with a custom skin:

*Inline snippets* are one line or less.

```rust
let mut skin = MadSkin::default();
skin.bold.set_fg(Yellow);
skin.print_inline("*Hey* **World!** Here's `some(code)`");
skin.paragraph.set_fgbg(Magenta, rgb(30, 30, 40));
skin.italic.add_attr(Underlined);
println!("\nand now {}\n", skin.inline("a little *too much* **style!** (and `some(code)` too)"));
```

Result:

![too much style](doc/too_much.png)

#### Texts

*Texts* can be several lines. Tables and code blocks are automatically aligned, justified and consistently wrapped.

```rust
skin.print_text("# title\n* a list item\n* another item");
```

### Scrollable TextView in a raw terminal:

![scrollable](doc/scrollable.png)

The code for this example is in examples/scrollable. To read the whole text just do

    cargo run --example scrollable

### Templates

In order to separate the rendering format from the content, you may want to have some constant markdown and fill some placeholders with dynamic items.

The `format!` macro is not always a good solution for that because you may not be sure the content is free of characters which may mess the markdown.

A solution is to use one of the templating functions or macros.

A template is to markdown what a prepared statement is to SQL: interpreted once and preventing the content to be interpreted as parts of the structure.

#### Inline Templates

Example:

```
mad_print_inline!(
    &skin,
    "**$0 formula:** *$1*", // the markdown template, interpreted once
    "Disk",  // fills $0
    "2*Ï€*r", // fills $1. Note that the stars don't mess the markdown
);
```

![mad_print_inline](doc/mad_print_inline.png)

Main difference with using `skin.print_inline(format!( ... ))` to build some markdown and parse it:
* the markdown parsing and template building are done only once (using `once_cell` internally)
* the given values aren't interpreted as markdown fragments and don't impact the style
* arguments can be omited, repeated, given in any order
* no support for fmt parameters or arguments other than `&str` *(in the current version)*

Inline templates are especially convenient combined with automated expansion or ellipsis, for filling a field in a terminal application.

You'll find more examples and advice in the *inline-template* example.

#### Text Template

When you want to fill a multi-line area, for example the help page of your terminal application, you may use a text template.

A template defines placeholders as `${name}` which you may fill when using it.

For example

```
let text_template = TextTemplate::from(r#"
    # ${app-name} v${app-version}
    It is *very* ${adj}.
    "#);
let mut expander = text_template.expander();
expander
    .set("app-name", "MyApp")
    .set("adj", "pretty")
    .set("app-version", "42.5.3");
skin.print_expander(expander);
```

This would render like this:

![text_template_01](doc/text_template_01.png)

The values you set with `set` aren't parsed as markdown, so they may freely contain stars or backquotes.

A template is reusable and can be defined from a text content or any string.

By using *sub-templates*, you may handle repetitions. They're handy for lists or tables.

For example

```
let text_template = TextTemplate::from(r#"
    |:-:|:-:|:-:|
    |**name**|**path**|**description**|
    |-:|:-:|:-|
    ${module-rows
    |**${module-name}**|`${app-version}/${module-key}`|${module-description}|
    }
    |-|-|-|
    "#);
let mut expander = text_template.expander();
expander
    .set("app-version", "2");
expander.sub("module-rows")
    .set("module-name", "lazy-regex")
    .set("module-key", "lrex")
    .set("module-description", "eases regexes");
expander.sub("module-rows")
    .set("module-name", "termimad")
    .set("module-key", "tmd")
    .set_md("module-description", "do things on *terminal*");
skin.print_expander(expander);
```

to get

![text_template_02](doc/text_template_02.png)

On this example, you can note that
* `sub("module-rows")` gets an expander for the sub template called `module-rows`
* `set_md` can be used when you want to insert not just a raw uninterpreted string but some inline markdown.
* you don't need to fill global placeholders again (here `${app-version}`).

If you want to insert a block of code, you may use `set_lines` which applies the line style to all passed lines.

For example

```
let text_template = TextTemplate::from(r#"
    ## Example of a code block
        ${some-function}
    "#);
let mut expander = text_template.expander();
expander.set_lines("some-function", r#"
    fun test(a rational) {
    irate(a)
    }
    "#);
skin.print_expander(expander);
```

to get

![text_template_03](doc/text_template_03.png)

You'll find more text template functions in the documentation and in the example (run `cargo run --example text-template`).

You may also be interested in `OwningTemplateExpander`: an alternative expander owning the values which may be handy when you build them while iterating in sub templates.

### Asking questions

A frequent need in CLI apps is to ask the user to select an answer.
The `Question` API and the `ask!` macros cover most basic needs.

Here's an example of asking with a default choice (that you get by hitting *enter*) and a returned value:

```rust
let choice = ask!(skin, "Do you want to drink something ?", ('n') {
    ('w', "I'd like some **w**ater, please.") => {
        mad_print_inline!(skin, "*Wait a minute, please, I'll fetch some.*\n");
        Some("water")
    }
    ('b', "Could I get a **b**eer glass ?") => {
        mad_print_inline!(skin, "We have no glass, so here's a *bottle*.\n");
        Some("beer")
    }
    ('n', "*No*, thank you.") => {
        None
    }
});
dbg!(choice);
```

## Advices to get started

* Start by reading the examples (in `/examples`): they cover almost the whole API, including templates, how to use an alternate screen or scroll the page, etc.
* Be careful that some colors aren't displayable on all terminals. The default color set of your application should not include arbitrary RGB colors.
* The event / event-source part of Termimad is currently tailored for a short number of applications. If you use it or want to use it, please come and tell me so that your needs are taken into account!
* If your goal is to format some CLI application output, for example a few tables, have a look at [lfs](https://github.com/Canop/lfs) which is one of the simplest possible uses
* If a feature is missing, or you don't know how to use some part, come and ping me on my chat during West European hours.
